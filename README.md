# CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
Compilation of my finished projects from the course Harvard's CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap.


Topics explored in this course include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. By semester’s end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet.
